# KRISHNA
# 🖌️ Radha-Krishna Turtle Art

This project uses Python's built-in **Turtle Graphics** module to draw a beautiful **Radha-Krishna artwork**.  
It combines intricate patterns, curves, and strokes to represent the divine figures, along with symbolic details like eyes, peacock feather, hair, ornaments, and facial features.

## ✨ Features
- Draws **Radha** with detailed facial outlines, ornaments, and hair.
- Draws **Krishna** with expressive eyes, crown-like head design, and peacock feather.
- Uses **multiple pensizes**, **angles**, and **circle arcs** for natural stroke effects.
- Runs on **pure Turtle Graphics** – no external libraries required.

> ⚠️ Run the code to generate the image, then take a screenshot or save it as `radha-krishna.png` and place it in the repo.
